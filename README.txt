Simple portfolio page integrated with unsplash API to display images dynamically.

    - Provide a main page containing grid that displays a beautiful list of images

    - When a user clicks/taps on a photo, a detailed view is displayed, showing a
        larger view of the image and any pertinent metadata. A good way to do this
        might be with a light box.

    - Provide a basic header or navigation container that contains a (mock) logo and
        links to the main page and an about page.

    - The about page should provide a simple page about the Author.

    - The app should be hosted somewhere publicly accessible that can be shared
        with the reviewers.

    -- Additional:  
        --- Added button to turn layout from masonary to grid
        --- Added button to display smaller images on larger devices if the user does not want to scroll
